        What is Blood Pressure?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Monitoring blood pressure is crucial for maintaining overall health and
        preventing various cardiovascular complications. By regularly checking
        blood pressure levels, individuals can identify any potential issues
        early on and take appropriate measures to manage them. High blood
        pressure, also known as hypertension, is a silent killer that can lead
        to heart disease, stroke, and other serious health problems if left
        untreated. Conversely, low blood pressure can cause dizziness, fainting,
        and organ damage if not monitored and managed properly. Regular
        monitoring of blood pressure is essential for promoting wellness,
        detecting abnormalities, and taking proactive steps to maintain
        cardiovascular health.
